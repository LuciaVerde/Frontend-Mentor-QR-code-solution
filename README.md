### What I learned
Although I am familiar with HTML, CSS and Sass, I was able to refresh several concepts that I had forgotten a bit, for example the application of media queries to make the site responsive.

```sass
.card {
    width: 20rem;
    background-color: $White;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    font-family: $font-family;

    @media (max-width:576px) {
        width: 17rem;
    }
```
